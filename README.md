# TET_specificity
This repository contains the scripts for the paper Pronounced sequence specificity guides cellular function of TET enzymes, Ravichandran et al.

## Components of the analysis

### Scripts
- Python script to quantitate methylation by hexamer (call_hexamers.py).
- Python script to sort methylation according to CGI location (classify_CGI.py).
- Python script to merge results and obtain summary tables (summarize.py).
- R Script to perform the Intra-motif positional preference analysis and plot the results  in R (IMPP_analysis.R).

### Datasets
- CpG Illingworth bed file converted to GRCm38 (CpG_Il_mm10.bed).
- Demethylation velocity table (Slope_summary.txt).
